# Peanut, the dietary restriction elephant

Peanut is a robotic companion for children with dietrary restrictions. He helps children learn what they can and cannot eat. Children interact with Peanut by feeding him play food and he responds by eating the food or informing the child that he cannot eat the food due to his allergy. To learn more about Peanut, how he was created, and the hardware that he uses go [here](http://www.jenn-thomas.com/dietary-elephant/).

The creation of Peanut was a collaboration between an upper level robotics class and child development class at Tufts University.
